# Python Playground

This repo contains bits of python code I have written as part of different python courses. I'm working my way through multiple courses on different parts of python as part of becoming fluent in the language. Each course has it's own subfolder which contains assignments, project files, and experiments I worked with as part of that course.

### Now
Right now, I am focusing on A Cloud Guru's [Introduction to Python Scripting](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/introduction-to-python-scripting/dashboard) course.
